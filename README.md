Stepping beyond teaching: Exploring writing as a career
Is writing the pathway for you? In this webinar, George Chilton, Creative Director at Hubbub Labs, talks about making the career shift from teaching to writing. He goes into how to grow your experience, test the waters and blaze a trail that both excites and challenges you. He'll explore your first steps, how to develop your skills, the types of work available and finding the right work for you. Join us on 21 July for this webinar looking at going beyond teaching into a career in materials writing.


 
World Teachers' Day 2022: call for speaker proposals
This year on 1 October, our World Teachers' Day Online Conference will be a truly global event, designed to reach every teacher in every part of the world. As with previous years, British Council TeachingEnglish will be hosting a series of talks, workshops and panel discussions that focus on the theme 'Teachers at the centre of a changing world'. We are looking for teachers and teacher educators around the world to deliver talks and workshops to a global audience.

 


 
Is slavery a thing of the past?
Designed to raise awareness of the UN's World Day against Trafficking in Persons on 30 July, this lesson for secondary and adult learners begins by asking students to consider what they know about the issue, then takes them through a process of learning more, before asking them what they have learned and how their understanding might have changed. The lesson involves plenty of speaking, a vocabulary focus, a jigsaw reading and a focus on passives.

Activities on the theme of summer
If summer holidays are approaching, it can be nice to base some of your lessons around this seasonal theme. Here is a selection of activities that you can use at lower levels. If you're looking for activities suited to intermediate learners and up, try Activities on the theme of summer 2. And finally, check out our beach-themed activities for primary learners here.

'Language teaching experiences during Covid-19'
The purpose of this research is to inform the understanding of teachers, trainers, managers and policymakers about the perceived impact of remote teaching on language teaching experiences during Covid-19. The report gives voice to 1,102 language professionals across 49 countries around the world and explores their teaching experiences at the height of Covid-19. It sheds light on their perceptions, challenges and opportunities as language instruction shifted online, and discusses what can be learned in light of this.
